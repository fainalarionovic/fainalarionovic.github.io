Entrepreneurship is best learned through hands-on experience rather than passive instruction. This section will emphasize the significance of practical learning opportunities, such as internships, projects, and real-world applications. By engaging in actual business scenarios, students not only develop essential skills but also cultivate resilience and adaptability—traits that are crucial for entrepreneurial success. Practical experience allows students to experiment, fail, and learn in a supportive environment, ultimately preparing them for the unpredictable nature of launching and sustaining a business.
